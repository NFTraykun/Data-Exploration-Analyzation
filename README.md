# Data-Exploration-Analyzation
Exploring COVID data to gain insights.

In this Project I downloaded data from www.ourworldindata.com/covid-deaths from Jan. 28th, 2020  to Apr 30th, 2021 to explore and gain insights from.

I looked at the data provided and made a gameplan for what stories I could tell with the data provided.

After I wrote all the SQL code I then made a dashboard in Tableau which you can view here with a summary of the data in a simplized form:

The SQL code that I wrote and also the data I used are all provided in this Github Repository.
