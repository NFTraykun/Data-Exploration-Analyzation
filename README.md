# Data-Exploration-and-Analyzation
Exploring COVID data to gain insights.

In this Project I downloaded data from www.ourworldindata.com/covid-deaths from Jan. 28th, 2020  to Apr 30th, 2021 to explore and gain insights.

I looked at the data provided and made a game plan for what stories I could tell with the data provided.

After I wrote all the SQL code I then made a dashboard in Tableau which you can view here with a summary of the data in a simplified form:

The SQL code that I wrote and also the data I used are all provided in this GitHub Repository.

P.S.
The SQL code is written in blocks with two dashes '--' at the top of each one followed by a comment of a short explanation for what each piece of code does.
